Q: How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?

A: In the terminal, writing 'git log' within the relevant repository will show all commits in chronological order, including the times they have been changed and by whom. 
'git log --stat' shows the files involved in any Commit, inlcuding the filepaths and any additions and removals of content indicated by '+' and '-'.

Q: How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?

A: The command 'git log --patch' can be used to show all the changes between commits, with '+' or '-' for any additions or removals of content in a file. 
You can also use the 'diff' command to show changes between your current file and the latest staged file / commit.

Q: What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within a merge conflict)

A: The HEAD refers to the most recent Commit.
